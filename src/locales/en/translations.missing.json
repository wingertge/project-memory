  "The core principle of this platform is learning, specifically languages (although if this works out well I might make a more generalized spinoff). We've developed as many tools as possible to make that task as easy as possible. We use a spaced repetition system (tuning still ongoing) to make sure you remember the words you learn for good. When inputting we automatically switch your IME mode (if applicable) so you don't have to hit annoying key combinations every time you switch between the native and learning language (trust me, I feel your pain). For languages that don't need an IME but aren't able to be typed on all keyboards, we've added converters for your convenience so you can learn to speak a language without the hassle of learning a new keyboard layout. Basically we've taken everything that annoyed us about competing platforms and fixed it as far as this was possible. Sadly, JavaScript IMEs still aren't possible for now but here's hoping. And if there's anything that bothers you, feel free to post it in the suggestions forum (which will come soon™, I promise).

  "Perhaps the thing that makes Project Memory unique is its extreme focus on community. That doesn't just mean sharing decks, but also more in depth articles via your feed or helping out other users directly through the messaging system (which will be implemented soon™). The more useful content you provide, the more reach you will gain and the more people can benefit from your skills in creating decks or writing informative articles. Who knows, perhaps there are even reward systems coming for those who are particularly prolific members of our community. But above all, community should mean being equal, and we enforce that principle as much as humanly possible.
