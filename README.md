### Project Memory Frontend
This is the repository for the Project Memory frontend. The backend is still private at this time due to security concerns.

#### Issues
Please try to explain your issue as best as possible. Press F12 to open the developer console, copy any errors into a codeblock or pastebin and include it in the issue. Also include the URL you were on at the time and the last few steps you did.

#### Pull Requests
I do accept pull requests if they fit the code quality and style of the repo. I don't use prettier since it's a bit *too* opinionated for my purposes, but just use common sense and the included tslint.json and you should be fine.
